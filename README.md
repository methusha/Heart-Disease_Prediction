# Heart Disease Prediction


## Description
This project is aimed towards creating a predictive machine learning application for rapid heart disease classification, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy in healthcare. The Random Forest algorithm, achieving a 91.8% accuracy, was selected as the optimal choice among a variety of predictive models. To allow for user interaction, the application was deployed using Streamlit, an open-source framework tailored for machine learning projects. Despite the moderately high accuracy, ongoing refinement of algorithm parameters is essential before responsibly deploying the tool into healthcare settings. Further research and optimization of these parameters are strongly recommended.


## How to Run the Project
This project can be accessed through the Streamlit Community Cloud. Access this link to run the project:

## How to Use the Project
Once you run the project, you will see a page resembling a form. Here, you can enter the health metrics of a patient and you will see whether or not they are likely to have heart disease. If you would like to test real-patient data, you can refer to the heart.csv file within this repository. This csv file has patient health metrics and whether they have heart disease or not.
