# Heart Disease Prediction

## Description
This project is aimed towards creating a predictive machine learning application for rapid heart disease classification, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy in healthcare. The Random Forest algorithm, achieving a 91.8% accuracy, was selected as the optimal choice among a variety of predictive models. To allow for user interaction, the application was deployed using Streamlit, an open-source framework tailored for machine learning projects. Despite the moderately high accuracy, ongoing refinement of algorithm parameters is essential before responsibly deploying the tool into healthcare settings. Further research and optimization of these parameters are strongly recommended.
